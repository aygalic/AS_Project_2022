Ideas:
- plot colors of the projected drug data which we know belong to a specific cancer type
- cluster analysis/knn to assign which cancer a drug probably works best on
- qantify that afterwards 
  - opens the door to anova (think of some H0's -> TODO)
  
- could box cox trasform some data -> new dim would be 266x28 (cell avgs) + 266x28 (lambdas from B-C) for future transforms 
  
-data reduction: construct feature vector w average auc scores across cell lines as features!!!
  - we can either consider averaging over cancer lines OR using clusters from Aygalic rpkm 
      - note: it is likely the case that each drug has a unique cluster of cells upon which group variance is minimized -> in
              which case can we do any better than choosing by the cancer types??



#some APIs/databases for drugs

Notes:
- my assumption for classifying drugs isn't bad as the number of cancers included increases...
- some drugs in the dataset aren't even in use anymore, e.g. read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linsitinib


TODO:
- Look at the loadings for PCAs
- visually check over the dim reduction results with reference to original auc 
- read over data description to see if cancer types are what they seem, i.e. BREAST primary finding in location 'breast'
- write a function for querying the data_sample data.frame to facilitate obtaining primary site of finding 
- AHFS database or labels for drugs

  
QUALMS:
- PCA doesn't make sense when considering a single cancer type.  We tricked ourselves into thinking there
were multiple features when in actuality its like the same feature but multiple measurements 
- My method of NA filling might be bad in the case where #NA>>#!NA since we're guessing a lot of measurements 
- Migratory cancer cells might be skewing the shapiro tests for our drugs ove a cancer class 


INTERESTING:
- all "Approved" drugs are labelled and represent 10% of the dataset. This sets up a really nice semi-unsupervised
framework for classifying unapproved drugs!
