Ideas:
- use drugbank api (PRIVATE) to assign either an appropriate cancer label or "INDETERMINATE" to a drug
    - hopefully i'll get access to free download 
- perform PCA on dataset with drug performances as samples
- plot colors of the projected drug data which we know belong to a specific cancer type
- cluster analysis/knn to assign which cancer a drug probably works best on
- qantify that afterwards

Notes:
- my assumption for classifying drugs isn't bad as the number of cancers included increases...
