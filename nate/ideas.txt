Ideas:
- cluster analysis/knn to assign which cancer a drug probably works best on
  
- could box cox trasform some data -> new dim would be 266x28 (cell avgs) + 266x28 (lambdas from B-C) for future transforms 
  
-data reduction: construct feature vector w average auc scores across cell lines as features!!!
  - we can either consider averaging over cancer lines OR using clusters from Aygalic rpkm 
      - note: it is likely the case that each drug has a unique cluster of cells upon which group variance is minimized -> in which case can we do any better than choosing by the cancer types??
      

#some APIs/databases for drugs

Notes:
- some drugs in the dataset aren't even in use anymore, e.g. read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linsitinib


TODO:
- write a function for querying the data_sample data.frame to facilitate obtaining primary site of finding 
- AHFS database or labels for drugs
- cluster drugs based on first few pc's based on the averaged table

SOME INTERESTING FEATURES TO LOOK INTO :
    * patient age
    * patient ethnicity 
    * genetic mutation rate of the cell culture -> see if correlated to age 
    * mutation rate 
    * cell doubling time 


  
QUALMS:
- PCA doesn't make sense when considering a single cancer type.  We tricked ourselves into thinking there were multiple features when in actuality its like the same feature but multiple measurements 
- My method of NA filling might be bad in the case where #NA>>#!NA since we're guessing a lot of measurements 
- Migratory cancer cells might be skewing the variances for our drugs ove a cancer class 
- reducing dataset to mean over cancer type and dropping NA rows suffers when we include cancer groups with few samples.  What might work better would be to only select top N cancers with most samples and cluster based on that 

- labelled drug dataset might not be useful in the case where i drop cancers as I assumed |type drugs| = |type cancers| 


INTERESTING:
- all "Approved" drugs are labelled and represent 10% of the dataset. This sets up a really nice semi-unsupervised
framework for classifying unapproved drugs!
