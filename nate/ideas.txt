Ideas:
- use drugbank api (PRIVATE) to assign either an appropriate cancer label or "INDETERMINATE" to a drug
    - hopefully i'll get access to free download 
- perform PCA on dataset with drug performances as samples
- plot colors of the projected drug data which we know belong to a specific cancer type
- cluster analysis/knn to assign which cancer a drug probably works best on
- qantify that afterwards 


#some APIs/databases for drugs

Notes:
- my assumption for classifying drugs isn't bad as the number of cancers included increases...
- some drugs in the dataset aren't even in use anymore, e.g. read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linsitinib


TODO:
- go back into tki jupyter and cold-search names of drugs that aren't in tki to see if we can uncover another
class of cancer treatment drug -> rinse and repeat.  Hopefully DrugBank has a similar page for those 
- Look at the loadings for the pairwise PCAs and for 6 major cancers 
- think about interpretation of not being able to do PCA once you have p too large
