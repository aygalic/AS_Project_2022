0_PREPROCESS
  * did we ever figure out why there were duplicates in the rpkm dataset?
  * whats the logic for removing low variance genes? counter argument: low variance 
    could be an indicator of a common expression of a cancer-causing mutation
  - line 25 normalizes samples (found on columns)
  - line 29 takes variance across rows 
  * how was 0.5 chosen as a threshold?
  - keeps high variance genes 
  
utilities.r
  * line 64: sums rows before normalizing, wasnt there a consideration we needed where certain 
    genes already had more expression initially which we need to account for? Ask pinoli again
  - line 55 + 57 already implicitly assumes we've removed duplicates.
  - default matrix loaded in this script is the non-duplicate, row-normalized, high-variance rpkm 
    generated in 0_PREPROCESS
    
  *[CONCERNING]* i dont think we should preprocess auc on the basis of removing NA's until an arbitrary threshold
      is met.  dataset should be querried and then processed when you have an application in mind 
      
  * utility for PCA could be reduced to two lines; princomp -> $scores[,ndim] and this is more coherent 
      
2_CELLS_CLUSTERING.R
  - yo results arent reproducible since dataset you generated at start isnt in the datasets folder, maybe add that 
  *[CONCERNING]* ALSO ALL RESULTS SEEM TO BE BASED ON ARBITRARY PREPROCESSING OF RPKM DATA
      - easy fix is to replace reference matrix whenever we want to perform an analysis 
  - 40: from preprocess you've normalized -> removed low var genes -> normalized again (???)
  * 56: not every possible tree is produced, e.g. ward.d2 method for clustering
  
2_GENES_CLUSTERING.R
  
workflow:
i) 1_rpkm.txt is new rpkm (0_PREPROCESS) 
ii) utilities defined reference this modified dataset as default param


list of assumptions:
RPKM 
- only keep high var genes 
- remove duplicates
- statistical samples are cells and they are normalized w.r.t gene expression 



IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:
- are the results you obtained derived from using the preprocessed rpkm dataset which inlcudes only high var, normalizes and no duplicates; and the auc one which is reduced to oblivion to meet a NA threshold?
